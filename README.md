# Prime Finder
Check if a number is prime or generate prime numbers to a file.

Checking if a number is prime by checking all numbers up to a square root of the given number, other (more efficient) algorithms might be added in the future (https://github.com/root-z/ECPP).

Generating prime numbers can be done using the Sieve of Atkin.
